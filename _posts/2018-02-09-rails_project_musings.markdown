I have just put the finishing touches on my rails project. This was a challanging but entertaining project for me, after having a pretty east time with my CLI gem project  and a pretty frustrating time with my Sinatra project it was nice to have one that was challening but not tear my hair out stressfull. I am always super interested in the way the projects expand my understanding of the curriculum but also the tools that come into sharper focus while building a project from scratch. For me with the particular project I found a new and devoted love for github. Never in the last two projects have I utilized the ability to restart from the last commit the way I did with my rails project. It was a life saver to say the least and gave me a real sense of freedom to try new things and new approaches to challenges with no fear of ruining my entire project. I think I have maybe five different versions saved in my "redos" folder and my leval of understanding of rails is sharper and more complete for it.
