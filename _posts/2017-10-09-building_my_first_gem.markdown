 I have just completed my CLI Data Gem Project. This is the first project I have done from scratch and while frustrating at times I feel like it has solidified many of the lessons I have learned thus far in the program. Like most people some concepts come easier than others and I seemed to have a block when it came to scraping. Through out the scraping lessons I just couldn't get into it and concentrate, after this project I have reversed my thought completely! It's really cool to see it play out in your code when you find just the right element to scrape. I was also a bit puzzled on the usefulness of pry prior to working on this project, I could see it's use but was not fully aware of how it would come in SO handy to warrant the praise I have heard for it. I am now so grateful for it, and 100% on team pry. This project challenged me in many ways, to fill in the gaps of information I may have missed going through the lessons, to push myself to complete just one more thing, and to do the best possible job I could. There was a moment where my code was good enough to pass in but just so. I could have left it there, but I took one more day and pushed myself to do it better. I am so glad that I did, because the reinforcement of concepts I gained by pushing myself to do it better will be invaluable. I really enjoyed this project and I am looking forward to continuing on with the course.
