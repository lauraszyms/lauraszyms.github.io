Sinatra was the hardest part of the course so far. I had a hard time understanding the expectations set forth in the labs and this added to my frustration with the subject matter. After all of it I am feeling so acomplished on having finally compleated the final projects! It is really interesting to be getting into the actual in's and out's of building a website. Seeing the code playing out in the browser gives me a sense of purpose and it does feel like the pieces of the puzzle are starting to come together. Thinking back to when I started the sinatra lessons and how confusing routes were versus now where I can see the logical cause and effect is pretty amazing! 

I made a dream journal for my portfolio project. I thought it was a fun idea for something to keep track of. I have always thougt of starting a physical dream journal but never got around to it. Really fun to have it digitised! After all of the work in the previous lessons the actual project was not as time consuming as some of the labs. It really did get repetative after all! I feel like I have a good handle on Sinatra which was at one point something I did not think would ever happen! Its worth going through to have my brain adjust to the logic. Hopefully it has prepared me for what is to come!
