I have really been enjoying learning React/Redux, conceptually I think this is my favorite of everything we have learned in this course. However, I have not quite grasped the material the way I ultimatly think I will. I have a solid understanding of the big picture and flow, but the little details have yet to fully connect. I am excited by the possibilities of programming with React/Redux beginning with my favorite project so far which when I execute what I have planned I will be most proud of. I am in the begining close to middle stages of this project and I have looked in lots of different places looking for some more clarity on React/Redux and thought I would share the ones that have been most helpful to me. 

React/Redux List:

[Codeacademy](http:///www.codecademy.com/) - Codeacademy is far less detailed than our curriculium here but is great for some light interactive practive to brush up on what we have learned. It's free and fun offering a React track but unfortunatly no Redux. 

[Treehouse](http://teamtreehouse.com/) - Treehouse is a great avenue for visual learners as their format is mostly video with resources provided in the teachers notes at the bottom of the screen. With occasional tests between videos where you can earn a badge for 100% its a pretty fun way to brush up on what we've learned here. There are several paid packages to choose from but a free 7 day trial for new users. 

[ReactJS](http://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html) - Reacts own site has a great example of creating a tic tac toe react game that is helpful to go through. 

Articles:

[A Flatiron Blog](http://www.thegreatcodeadventure.com/the-react-plus-redux-container-pattern/) This one about container components from a flatiron instruction was super helpful! 

[Seperation of Concerns Article](http://medium.com/prod-io/react-redux-architecture-part-1-separation-of-concerns-812da3b08b46)

[Simple React/Redux Example](http://blog.tylerbuchea.com/super-simple-react-redux-application-example/)




If anyone else is having trouble with putting all the peices together with this project I hope these resources can help. While I am not up to where I want to be in my understanding I did gain some clarity by looking into it further.
