At the start of this journey I had no idea what to expect. All I knew was I was interested in using my somewhat inconviently logical brain to learn something new. A coworker who had done a bootcamp was the one to recomened I give coding a try. I was instantly hooked. Everyone talks about the amount of work that goes into learing programming but I rarely hear about the great sense of satisfaction that comes from it. For every frustration there is a moment of payoff. Finding the anwer. Solving the puzzle. I love that it's never ending and there is just a vast ocean of ever changing technology. Impossible to ever get bored. I have so enjoyed learnign here at flatiron. I can't believe how far i've come! It's fun to think back to those days at the begining when things that come so easily now were strange and mysterious. I am looking forward to going back over my old projects and implementing new features and exploring the new skills I have gained. This is the first step in a great new adventures and I am so excited to keep learing and see what comes next!
