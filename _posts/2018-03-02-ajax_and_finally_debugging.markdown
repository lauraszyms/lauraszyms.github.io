Wow this project was a doosy. I never reallly felt like I had a handle on JavaScript, I got by and could make things work but the information never seemed to stick. This project was such an amazing achievment for me in that I finally dove into an unsersannd of not just what to do but why, AND, i finally got a handle on debugger!! I have blogged before about my love of pry and how I never really understood it's merits until my first project. Well this was a nice repeat in that I never really got a grip on how debugger worked or when to use it and I feel like a debugging pro after this project. Closing thoughts: it feels really good to begin to see the code I am writing taking shape dynamiclly in my projects.
